## Overview

**Client-side :** in the client side we are using `script.js` 
* for creating a chatbot, it imports two SVG images for the user and bot profile pictures,it then creates a form element and a chat container element .
* It then defines the function for loading,typing text,generating unique IDs, and creating chat stripes. The handle submit function is created to handle the form submission.
* It takes the users' input from the form,adds it to the chat container as a chatstripe and then fetches data from server to get the bot's response.Then the response is added to the chat container as another stripe.. then typed out using typeText().
* Finally an event listener is added to the both submit and keyup events on the form element..

**Server-side :** in the server side we are using `server.js`
